------- Angular ----


-> Angular: What and Why

	-> Used for Building web applications
	-> Framework deployed by google
	-> To create dynamic single page application(SPAs)

-> Tools and features

	-> Use variables in HTML: data Binding
	-> Work with dependency injection
	-> Easily set up routing
	-> Handle forms

-> Uses of Angular

	-> Simple websites
	-> Complicated websites applications

-> Benefits of Angular

	-> Gives your applications structure
	-> Provides scalability

-> Angular vs. Competitors

	-> React.js
	-> Vue.js
	-> Angular
		-> Angular encourages a clean and organized codebase
		-> Easier maintenance and scalability
		-> Angular is often preferred by big corporations
		-> Strong community and regular updates
		-> Up-to-date with the latest web development trends

2-Setting up the Angular Environment

	-> Download and install Visual studio code
		-> code.visualstudio.com
		-> Add extensions
	-> Install Node.js
		-> The engine that runs JS code outside browsers
		-> nodejs.org (www.nodejs.org.com)
		-> Also, installs npm
	-> npm
		-> Node package manager
	-> Install the Angular command-line-interface(CLI)
		-> For easily creating and managing Angular project
		-> npm install -g @angular/cli

	
	Note: Check if everything is installed correctly

		-> Node.js: node -v
		-> npm: npm -v
		-> Angular CLI: ng version

3-Creating our first Angular App

	-> ng new <project name>
	-> ng serve ---open

4-Angular CLI

	-> Angular command-line interface
	-> Tools for scaffolding and managing Angular projects
	-> Saves time by generating boilerplate code
	-> Enforces Angular best practices

	-> Common Commands

		-> Creating new project: ng new <project name>
		-> Serving the app: ng serve --open
		-> Generating files: ng generate component/service/pipe/etc
		-> Building for production : ng build
		
		-> Why Angular CLI is helpful
	
			-> Automatically updates configuration files and creates new folders
			-> Helps avoid mistakes
			-> Helps work faster
			-> Maintains a consistent structure
			-> Aligns with best practices

5-Structure of Angular Applications

	-> package.json

		-> Heart of projects dependencies
		-> Lists all packages the app needs
			-> Angular
			-> Typescript
			-> Various Libraries

	-> node_modules

	-> angular.json

		-> Here lies the Angular CLI configuration
		-> It defines how our project is build and tested and it's includes for different environments and build options
	
	-> tsconfig.json

		-> Typescript configuration file
		-> Sets rules for Typescript compilation
		-> Supports code consistency
		-> Catches errors early

	-> .gitignore

		-> This file tells git which files or folders to ignore and not send to the remote such as GitHub or GitLab
		-> This prevents unnecessary files such as the huge node modules folder or sensitive files containing environment secrets from being tracked in a version control

	-> src

		-> The application code lives here

		-> main.js
	
			-> This is the entry point of our application
			-> It bootstrap the Angular App essentially kicking off the whole process

		-> index.html

			-> This is main html file that Angular injects our app into.
			-> This determines what we will see on the page

		-> styles.css

			-> This file contains global styles for our app affecting the look and feel across all components
			-> its where we can set up color screens, typography and overall design aesthetics

		-> app

			-> it's a Asset components.
			-> This is where our applications, component services and other core functionalities resides.
			-> files

				-> app.component.css
				-> app.component.html
				-> app.component.spec.ts
				-> app.component.ts
				-> app.config.ts
				-> app.route.js

		-> Public

			-> This is the folder for aesthetic assets.
			-> Images and other files that don't require processing by Angular.
			-> It's great place to store your assets

6-Chellenge:Clear the HTML

		-> Steps
			-> Create the starter app
			-> Remove the content from app.component.html
	
7-Solution: Clear the HTML

		-> Solution
	
			-> ng new course-booking-system
