
----- Advance Feature of Angular ----


-> Install docker
-> Node.js
-> npm
-> Angular cli



-> Feature Module
-> Shared Module

-> Dumb component -  Display input and output data  - Stateless
-> Smart component - Having servicing , data and logic - Stateful

-> Project organization

	-> Compunents
	-> Modules
	-> Services
	
	-> By features or functions

		-> Contact list  -> Component - Component - Template  - Service - Module
		-> Company list  -> Component - Component - Template  - Service - Module
		-> Add new contact -> Component - Component - Template  - Serviced
	
-> Routing
	
	-> SimpleRoute
	-> DynamicRoute
	-> NestedRoute

-> Protecting routes with guards

	->  Controls the routing with Route Guards

	-> Type of Route Guards

		-> CanActivate  - 
		-> CanDeactivate - Prevents users from Navigating away from a route
		-> CanLoad - Prevents loading entire lazy-loaded modules
		-> CanActivateChild - Works like CanActivate but to child routes
		-> Resolve - Pre-fetches data before a route is activated

-> Lazy Loading and onPush

	-> const routes : Routes = [
		{
			path: 'dashboard',
			loadChildren: () =>
				import('./dashboard/dashboard.module').then((m) => m.DashboardModule),
		},
		];
		
	-> OnPush change detection strategy

		-> @Component ({
			selector: 'app-component',
			changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
			templateUrl: './mycomponent.component.html',
		})
		
		export class Mycomponent {}
		
	
-> Unit Tesing with Jasmine and Karma

	-> app.component.spec.ts
	-> ng test
	-> 

-> AOT and Build optimization

	-> AOT - Ahead of Time Compilation
		-> Faster rendering
		-> Smaller bundles
		-> Better error deduction

	-> Build Optimization
		-> Tree Shaking
		-> Minification
		-> Bundling

-> Continuous integration and development (CI/CD)

	-> Travis-ci.com
		-> OpenSource
	-> Jenkins
		-> OpenSource
	> GitHub Action

	> BitBucket Pipelines

-> Global Error Handling and app monitoring

	-> Sentry.io
	-> logrocket.com
	-> raygun.io
	-> rollbar.com
	
	-> Benefits of real time monitoring

		-> Immediate alerts
		-> Detailed stack traces
		-> Error Context
		-> Session Replay
		-> Collaborative debugging
