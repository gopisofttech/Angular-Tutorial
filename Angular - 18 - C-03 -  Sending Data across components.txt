----- Sending Data across components -----

1-Parent-child communication

	-> One component is inside the other
	-> Inner component is the child
	-> Outer component is the parent

2-The @Input Decorator

	-> For  communicating from the parent to the child
	-> Allow parent component to pass data down to child
	-> Dynamic
	-> Reusable components
	-> Offers flexibility

	-> What is @Input property

		-> Marks a property as an input property
		-> Enables data flow from parent to child
		-> The flow

			-> In the parent component, bind to the child's @Input property using property binding syntax
			-> In the child component, use @Input to receive data


3-The @Output Decorator and Event Emitters

	-> @Output

		-> @Output marks a property as an output property to emit events from child to parent
		-> In the child component, create EventEmitter and decorate it with @Output
		-> In the parent component, listen for the emitted event
		-> Specify function in the parent to handle event
