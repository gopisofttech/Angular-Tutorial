----- Code Linting -----

-> Code Linting
	-> Also called "Static code analysis"
	-> Checks for errors without running the code
	-> Standardizes how you write source code
	-> Consistency between developers

-> TSLint

	-> Https://palantir.github.io/tslint
	-> Included with Angular
	-> Deprecated in 2019
	-> use ESLint instead : https://eslint.org

-> ESLint

	-> npm install eslint --save-dev
	-> npx eslint --init
	-> npx eslint src/app/app.component.ts
	-> npm uninstall tslint
	
	-> npm install eslint-plugin-import --save-dev
	-> npm install eslint-plugin-prefer-arrow-jsdoc --save-dev

	-> npx eslint src/
	-> npx eslint src --fix

	-> install ESLint extension

-> EditorConfig

	-> Https://editorconfig.org
	-> A way to standardize files across team members
	-> Different from Static code analysis
	-> Works locally in the editor
	-> Works in real time
	-> Can use one files across all your projects
	-> But most projects have their own file
	-> Add the EditorConfig for VScode extension
