-> Performance Metrics

	-> Measure how fast and responsive your app feels
	-> Can't replace real world testing
	-> Still a good proxy for speed, responsiveness and visual stability
	-> Fixing your metrics will help real world scenarios

	-> Start here
		-> First contentful paint(FCP)
			-> How long it takes the browser to render the first piece of content
			-> shorter times are better : aim for 1.8 seconds or less on mobile devices

		-> Largest contentful paint(LCP)
			-> How long it takes the browser to render the largest piece of visible content
			-> Shorter times are better: aim for 2.5 seconds or less on mobile devices

		-> Total blocking time (TBT)
			-> How long users must wait before they can interact with content
			-> Shorter times are better: aim for 200 seconds or less on mobile devices
			
		
		-> Cumulative layout shift(CLS)
			-> The amount of layout shift that happens as your page loads
			-> Lower scores are better: aim for 0.1 or less on all devices

		-> Speed index
			-> Overall perceived speed  and visual completeness of your webpage
			-> Shorter times are better: aim for 3.4 seconds or less on mobile devices


	-> Track as needed

		-> Interaction to next paint(INP)
		-> First paint
		-> First meaningful paint(FMP)	
		-> Time to first byte(TTFB)
		-> Time to interactive

	-> Developed by google.

	-> Run Lighthouse

		-> Inside your web browser
		-> From the command line
		-> As a node module

	-> Generate a Light House report

		-> Mode
			-> Navigation (Default)
